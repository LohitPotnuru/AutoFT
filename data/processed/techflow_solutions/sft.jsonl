However, I'm still unable to access these tools. Could you please help me understand the delay?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Thank you for choosing our Enterprise tier. As a part of our security measures, Enterprise accounts like yours require manual domain verification, which typically takes 24-48 business hours. Rest assured, we've sent a verification email to your domain administrator. Once they verify the domain, your account will be activated automatically. Please check with your administrator to confirm they received the email. If you have an urgent need to access these tools, please do let us know. We can request expedited processing for your account, though it requires manager approval. We will also set a follow-up reminder to check your activation status. We appreciate your patience and understanding."}]}

This is causing failures in our workflows. We need a solution to this issue."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I understand that you've hit the API rate limit for the Professional tier (1,000 calls/hour). This limit is put in place to ensure system stability for all users. You have a few options: 1) Optimize your workflows to reduce API calls. We have documentation on best practices for API optimization I can provide. 2) Upgrade to the Enterprise tier, which allows for 10,000 calls/hour (or custom limits). If you choose to upgrade, the billing would be prorated. 3) Request a temporary limit increase if this is a one-time spike in usage. I'm here to help, whether that's in optimizing your current workflows or discussing an upgrade."}]}

Your Starter tier includes access to 3 starter templates. To access the full template library (15 templates), you'd need to upgrade to our Professional tier ($99/month).

I see you're trying to use HTTP. To resolve this, you'll need to: 1) Ensure your webhook endpoint uses HTTPS, 2) Install a valid SSL certificate (Let's Encrypt offers free certificates), and 3) Test the endpoint using our webhook test tool. Once your SSL certificate is valid, you can configure the webhook. Would you like me to send you our FlowBuilder Pro webhook setup guide?"}]}

It's frustrating not understanding why I'm unable to perform certain tasks. Can you explain this?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I understand your concern. It seems you're trying to access a workflow that belongs to a specific team within your organization. Our platform, FlowBuilder Pro, uses a team-based access control system. Workflows are assigned to teams, and only team members can access them. You are indeed a member of the organization, however, you are not assigned to the team that owns the workflow you're trying to access. To gain access, an organization admin or team admin needs to add you to that specific team. Would you like me to help you contact your team admin?"}]}

You can choose from: 1) Last-write-wins (most recent change takes precedence), 2) Source-priority (source database always wins), or 3) Manual-review (conflicts flagged for your review). To configure this, go to your sync job settings > Conflict Resolution. Would you like me to walk you through setting this up?"}]}

To restore a previous version, follow these steps: 1) Navigate to the overwritten file in CloudVault, 2) Click the 'Version History' button (represented by a clock icon), 3) This will bring up a list of all the previous versions of the file. Preview the versions to find the one you want to restore, 4) Click 'Restore' on the desired version. Please note that restoring a file creates a new version with the old content - your current version will remain in history and not be deleted. Would you like me to guide you through this process in real-time?"}]}
